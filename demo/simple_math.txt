*** Test Cases ***
Opertions with private variables
    ${s1}=    Get Time    year    #use Get Time Method to get this year as a string
    ${n2}=    Set Variable    ${100}    #assign a constant integer value
    Should Be Equal As Integers    ${n2}    100    #conver to number to compare
    ${n3}=    Evaluate    ${s1}+${n2}    #conver to number and sum to total

test Condition
    ${i}    set variable    ${1}
    run keyword if    ${i} == 1    log    aaaa
